# Simple Calculator
<p>React + TypeScript + StyledComponents</p>

<p>This project is a calculator that simulates the old simple calculators. I tried to replicate the functionalities and responses shown on the display as closely as possible. All components, both the buttons and the numbers on the display, are made with images created by me.</p>
